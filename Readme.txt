August 15, 1971 - Palo Alto, California. Early morning.

Twelve college students are picked up from their homes by police, placed under arrest, and brought to a temporary jail set up in the basement of Stanford University.
Despite the appearances, it is all about research on the psychology of detention led by Stanford's professor Philip G. Zimbardo. 
Twenty-four volunteers have agreed to spend the next two weeks recreating life in a correctional facility. Twelve of them are officers, twelve are prisoners.

And this is our LOD project about it.

Team: Laura Travaglini, Diego Chillo, Andrea Zanetti.
